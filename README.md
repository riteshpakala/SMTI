Social Media Threat Intelligence

This will be a brief trial study from events that occured July 2023, up until now. I intend to update and conduct monitoring within my free time up until November 2026. Only focusing on societal/political impact.

I find this area interesting to look into, especially post COVID-era, where lots of online-habits got trained and now slowly untrained. Thus, the rise of AI user-based social media platforms exposes a new adaptation. An increase in safety is immediately seen, as human-facing users are known to be unpredictable. As this market grows, the unintended side-effects will be observed.
