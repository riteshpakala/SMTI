# Influencers
An open study on Influencers that *choose* to be available on open/public domains.

There's a caveat here, a formal retreat into private groups on mediums such as Discord/Telegram/WhatsApp/WeChat/Forums. Which is still fair-game (case-by-case), but reach can be much smaller. Thus, this will put a greater emphasis on the campaigns category - exploring how information can spread covertly directly or indirectly.
