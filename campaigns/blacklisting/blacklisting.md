Speaking against the status-quo of market movement and general direction of the Silicon Valley. I do not want to speak further on this topic, but would like to plant a seed, until I get the data required. If no data can get required, this will get removed. 

Speaking against, does not mean they won't help. It's called freedom-of-thought and sometimes simply caring about their peers.
