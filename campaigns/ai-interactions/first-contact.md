During the boom of Lemmy, June 2023, a huge influx of users left Reddit to build standalone clients. The removal of applications like [Apollo](https://www.reddit.com/r/apolloapp/), due to the introduction of Reddit API usage costs, began a wave of iOS/Android applications to be built. Lemmy was a free alternative backend, a testing ground, and a great resume builder as layoffs in the tech-industry were prominent. 

Lot's of users found this to be a great way to not only engage with others on a new social platform, but to build together, and enter the open-source world for the first time. The open-source world always found it tough, to induct the next generation and it felt like it was finally happening. It was the first time, I myself, saw iOS applications being shared, en masse, ready to go fully available within github repos. 

Even though this was during the second/third ChatGPT hype cycle, it wasn't paid attention to, that much, versus other social networks. But, into July's end, early August one could begin to see patterns in certain threads on Lemmy's network.
